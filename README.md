PonchoPants
===========

PonchoPants maximizes the efficiency of bike share programs around the world.  More people are signing up for bike share every day, and two of the biggest problems participants face are: 1) Finding a bike when they want one; and 2) Parking a bike closest to their destination.  PonchoPants enables participants to select their primary bike share origins and destinations and receive alerts when those stations are about to become empty or full.  Each station is assigned a rating chart throughout the day based on the average number of bikes and docks available for each 30 minute period.

PonchoPants also provides estimated wait times for primary origins alternative locations, so the participant can make an informed decision whether to wait for a bike to be returned or to walk to another station.
